      <h1>Hello my Valentine, my partner, my beloved — and most especially, my girlfriend.</h1>
      <p>I hope this website is worth your time. I didn’t build this to compensate for what I did, or what I failed to do, but to give you reassurance — that you are heard, that you are seen, and that I truly know a side of you that no one else in this world gets to see but me.</p>
      <p>I’m sorry for forgetting something that mattered to you. I see now how much it hurt, and I never wanted to make you feel unknown or overlooked.</p>
      <p>Would you allow me to make it up to you?</p>

          BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
        </h2>
        <p>
          I want to start this by saying that this isn’t meant to overwhelm you,
          impress you, or pressure you into forgiving me. I’m doing this because
          I needed to pause and truly reflect on you — not just as my
          girlfriend, but as a person I care for and cherish deeply. I’ve
          realized that knowing someone isn’t about remembering every detail
          perfectly. It’s about paying attention, listening, and choosing to
          keep learning. I failed to do that in a moment that mattered, and I’m
          truly sorry. I’ve come to understand that loving someone means making
          them feel seen and known. That realization is the exact reason this
          website exists. It’s here to reassure you that you are acknowledged,
          that you matter, and that you are loved. Everything here is written
          with honesty. Some things I know about you with certainty. Some things
          I’m still learning. And some things I hope to understand better — from
          you. You don’t have to read everything all at once. Take your time.
          This space isn’t going anywhere.

          WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU
        </h2>
        <p>
          These are the things that I’ve noticed and have known about you
          throughout the course of our relationship, the things that make you,
          you. I may not know everything, but I want to show you that I see you,
          that I remember, that I care.
        </p>

          You are Angel Ahlia Chantengco, a beautiful, pretty, strong,
          independent, and adventurous young woman born on February 20, 2008.
          You approach life with a sense of courage and excitement, with a
          profound love for friends and especially your family. You love your
          mommy, ma, tang, tito, tita, and especially Jirroy. You and your mommy
          are a best friend duo, the one at which you can open up to whenever
          you need a shoulder. Your ma and tang are the ones who raised you,
          took care of you, and cherished you while your mommy was away. You
          have your titos from the very moment you were born, with Tito Gene
          sharing a sibling bond with you, with both of you having similar
          characteristics like being a Swiftie and a fondness for travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re a cat lover, with Tofu and Momo being one of your most beloved
          pets in your life. You expressed how much they meant to you, and how
          much they’ve brought you joy and laughter throughout their lives. You
          introduced them to me even before we confessed to each other, often
          sending me selfies with them. I still remember the very first selfie
          that you gave me, the one at which had a filter of gold mask while I
          sent a selfie back with a filter of Iron Man. One of your hobbies
          before I even met you was baking, even giving me a corndog wrapped in
          plastic as a souvenir from the first few times I went to your house.
          You insisted that I take it and eat it or else you would be mad and
          kick me out of your house indefinitely, which I found cute at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your favorite color is pink, which is obvious, but was originally blue
          – sky blue to be exact. You talked about how one point, your Lola Baby
          teased you at why sky blue was your favorite color when it was meant
          to be for boys, but you being you, you stood up for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of your favorite things to eat is baked sushi, a staple of the
          many things you loved to make. Apart from that, you grow a fondness
          towards foods such as xiaolongbao, so much so that you even went to
          your Tito at SM back then just to eat with them because they had your
          favorite in the restaurant they were in. You love foods like ramen,
          sushi, especially the one in Makimura, Volcano Roll, often talking
          about how you want to buy a platter (I also know that this is the same
          sushi you got when you finally said yes to me being your boyfriend on
          28th of March last year). Moreover, you love pizza and chicken,
          especially 24 Chicken with Jack Daniels and Snow Cheese being the
          first things we’ve tried on our first date at Angeles. You love
          shawarma, often ranking Kamir as the best you’ve tasted by far,
          followed with passport food. You love Ilao Ilao, Ilocos Empenada and
          bibingka, specifically the one in Angeles, and one of the recent
          turnarounds, Takoyaki. You expressed your hatred towards Takoyaki
          before, but eventually you’ve grown to love the delicacies yourself.
          You love onigiri and musubi too, to the point that you made Pastigiri.
          One of the many moments where your creativity and love for food shone
          into the spotlight, with Pastigiri even gaining a liking from my
          parents themselves. I remembered how people were still trying to even
          order even though it was already out of stocked. I remember how we
          shared a piece together because you still wanted to eat some, but all
          of them were already taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t drink soft drinks, which I admire the most about you. So
          much so that I’ve been following your principle too. But whenever you
          do decide to indulge in drinks, you favor matcha above all others. I
          actually didn’t like matcha before, but because of you, I’ve grown to
          enjoy it myself. I still remember the video you sent me from your trip
          to Baguio with Tito Gene — that three-day, two-night trip your mommy
          planned for you. In it, you were sipping matcha tea, a little left on
          your lips, and I couldn’t help but smile seeing how much you enjoyed
          it and how silly you looked (in a good way). I remember the journey
          there too — taking the bus from SMC, arriving hungry, complaining to
          me while I was still asleep, and deciding to grab a burger from McDo
          before continuing your adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You love songs, you don't usually listen to songs wholeheartedly, but
          you tell me that you still like to listen to music once in a while.
          You love NIKI, as you told me her songs have gotten you through rough
          times, with Ocean and Engines being your anthem at the time we were in
          a bad argument and misunderstanding. You don't just love her music,
          but you also love the artist as well, even your Tito bought you a
          hoodie during her tour, the tour at which you told me that you wanted
          to go but couldn't because of school.
        </p>
        <p>
          You play games, but not that much anymore like before. You played ML,
          the same game you played during the pandemic with your friends before
          eventually moving to CODM. You loved Hanabi, the same as much as how
          you loved playing CODM with your friends. The same game we eventually
          crossed paths with, I still remember how you named your Holger my
          name. You lost a bet while we were playing with our friends, and at
          the time I already had feelings for you, which is why I made you name
          it after me. You like Roblox too, with 99 Nights being one of your go
          to games back then to play with me. Some games you also played were
          Good Coffee, Great Coffee and the Airplane Chef you played a bit, the
          one photo where you tried the game a random night. But one things for
          sure, you play games with me because you want to spend time with me,
          and that is one of the sweetest things you’ve done for me.

          THE THINGS ONLY I GET TO SEE
        </h2>
        <p>
          All of what I said are merely just the basics of Angel Ahlia
          Chantengco. Stuff that other people know about, things that they may
          also notice, or traits that they also see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes some may know that you hate spicy foods, but they wouldn’t know
          how you feel disgusted whenever you even see a sight of a hot sauce in
          front of you, let alone when it’s mixed with other things. You hate
          seeing spice as much as you hate seeing pickles in a burger. The green
          guys who you always give me whenever we go out for burgers, the same
          way as you leave out the crust of a pizza. They wouldn’t really know
          that the ever courageous Angel would be scared of washing dishes,
          especially if the dishes include vinegar or soy sauce, which makes you
          even less than willing to wash them. They might not know how you
          behave when you’re on the road, how frightened you get when a car is
          heading straight at you. They most certainly would never hear you,
          Moira, sing spontaneously in your bathroom at night while doing your
          skincare. The skincare that you do every single night, the exact thing
          that doesn’t let you sleep not until you finally have rinsed and
          washed your face. They won’t get the same chance that I have to spend
          late night walks with you, the kind that makes your heart ache of
          happiness from the moment that we share a night under the moonlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          They don’t see a side of you that I do, the side that you only share
          to the closest around you. They will never see you sleep on their
          shoulder at a jeepney going home nor sleep in general, while you drool
          away your thoughts. I always laugh, not because I’m making fun of you,
          but because of how innocent you look whenever you sleep. It’s hard to
          think that they would also know that between 1PM to 4PM and past 11PM,
          your messages are a ticking time bomb. One moment you’re replying, but
          once I notice that “Active 10 mins ago” mark below your profile, I
          know sleep has already taken you away. I know how much you move around
          whenever you sleep, how sometimes you speak when sleeping, even though
          you wouldn’t admit it, but I’ve already seen it on our sleep calls. I
          know that you love to be lullabied to sleep, to be sang a song until
          you finally sleep the night away.
        </p>
        <p>
          I notice how food makes you happy, at in one instant, the grumpy, mad,
          and curled eyebrows you have can change into a happy dance that you
          make whenever you’re served your favorite meals. I love how intimate
          you are and how you always reach for a camera the second a moment is
          happening. The way you want to capture every glimpse of a moment to
          store it as a memory to look back on. I know how you crave to be taken
          candid pictures yourself, and how you want me to do the same too. I
          know how want surprises too, from surprise visits to surprise food,
          that cheer you up after a tiring and long day. I remember how Dos,
          Panpan, Rose made you feel the moment I gave them to you, how your
          eyes brighten up whenever you receive a handwritten letter. The kind
          of gifts that take effort to make, the ones that make you happy and
          appreciative off.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things that I’ve mentioned are not memorized, but rather the
          small details and tendencies I’ve noticed as because I was paying
          attention. And I still want to keep paying attention, better and more
          observant than before.

          SOFT SIDE
        </h2>
        <p>
          After three years of being together, I’ve grown to deeply appreciate
          the side of you that not everyone gets to see. While others see the
          independent and strong Ahlia, I get to see the soft and vulnerable
          side — the one you only give access to those you truly love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know how deeply you love someone, even when it reaches the point
          where you end up hurting too. I admire how you love your family
          wholeheartedly — how you take care of them, cherish the moments you
          spend together, and genuinely look out for their well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve seen the side of you that wanted to give up so badly, yet still
          refused to surrender. Whether it was a problem in our relationship,
          academics, or family, you always found the strength to push through.
          I’ve seen you cry multiple times — and at times, I know I was the
          reason — but what stays with me is how you rebuild yourself and come
          back stronger every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see how much you push yourself to grow, to improve, and to reach
          your dreams. I know how dedicated you are to your academic excellence,
          not only for your mommy, but also for yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I admire how you always stand your ground, especially when you know
          you are right. You may be direct at times, but you have a strong moral
          compass that you stay true to. You make sure your voice is heard, and
          you never allow anyone to invalidate your opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are brave, strong, resilient, and most of all, loving and caring.
          These are the traits that made me fall for you in the first place.
          Beyond your humor, beauty, and intelligence, it’s the way you protect
          the people you love — and how far you’re willing to go for them — that
          truly sets you apart.

          HOW YOU LOVE
        </h2>
        <p>
          The way you love is genuine, grand, and deeply felt. You don’t love
          loudly for attention, you love through actions, consistency, and care.
        </p>
        <p>
          You love by remembering small things. By putting in effort such as
          setting up dates. By choosing to stay, even when things get difficult.
          You give your time, your energy, and your presence to the people who
          matter to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You love through effort. Through patience. Through showing up in ways
          that aren’t always seen, but are always felt. When you care about
          someone, you do everything you can to make them feel safe, supported,
          and valued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you love someone, you love deeply, sometimes even at the cost
          of yourself. And while that shows how big your heart is, it’s also
          something I’ve learned to respect and be more mindful of. You deserve
          a love that protects you as much as you protect others. The kind of
          love that you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t give your heart easily, but when you do, it’s sincere and
          profound. Your love is honest. It’s loyal. It’s direct. And it’s real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being loved by you is not about grand gestures, it’s about knowing
          your loved one, and showing genuine care for who they are. And that is
          something I will never take lightly or for granted ever again.

          WHAT I PROMISE
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’ve said some of these words before, even long before all of this
          happened. But now, understanding what’s truly at stake, I want to say
          them with more awareness — and more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve realized how much we’ve both changed, how time and distance have
          made it harder for us to address things properly, and how much we owe
          each other understanding and accountability. I hear everything you’ve
          told me, and I respect the plans and boundaries you’ve shared about
          your future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I’ve made mistakes. I know I’ve caused pain. And instead of
          trying to erase that, I want to take responsibility for it and do
          better — consistently, not just in words.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re right that patterns can repeat if nothing truly changes. That’s
          something I’ve reflected on deeply. And if I’m given the chance, I
          don’t want to repeat the same cycle — I want to rebuild with
          intention, patience, and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I promise to never let you feel unseen or unknown again. To listen
          more attentively. To be more present. To remember that loving you
          means paying attention even when life gets busy or difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to be someone who brings you peace, not stress. Someone who
          supports you and comforts you through exhaustion, anxiety, and
          pressure — not adds to it. I don’t promise a relationship without
          disagreements, but I do promise one built on respect, communication,
          and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still believe in a future where we love each other better than
          before — not perfectly, but honestly. A future where we both feel
          secure, valued, and understood.
